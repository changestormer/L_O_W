A Leaf over the wall, L_O_W.  After we iron out the bugs on the security infrastructure, this will be more active

Up until ver .5 or so, FREENET was possibly the most secure method of internet communication on this planet (it was also slow, confusing, buggy, and a subject of heated discourse).

ONE of the intentions was to make a platform that could circumvent the great firewall. My personal focus as a programmer was to make Freenet capable of communicating in ways that would not reveal it's existance to a censor in as many different ways as possible; PING packets, DNS queries, "broken" GET's, etc. Most of these methods would only support text communications and VERY slowly at that, but they mostly worked.

Then a new team took control.

A new spinoff called FCON, based on the pre-insecure code was started, but I moved on.

Recently I was checking out the specs of a SmartTV and had an epiphany...If you check out Apache SPARK, and look at IoT frameworks...

I'm working on the infrastructure. after I get the bugs stomped out, I'll throw this open for public input. and, while the commo can't be completely open source, some way of checking my work will have to be determined.

The Bunny Shall Hop Again!
